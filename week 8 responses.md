<h2>Cathy O Neil Weapons Of Math Destruction Chapter 4</h2>

The influence of WMDs on education is examined in "Weapons of Math Destruction" Chapter 4. It explores the emergence of standardized testing and how, by limiting the curriculum, rewarding test-focused instruction, and designating students and institutions as failures due to faulty measurements, it contributes to inequality. The chapter also covers the ways in which algorithms employed in hiring and college admissions procedures might exacerbate prejudice by favoring some groups over others and so escalating social inequality. It draws attention to the negative effects of using ambiguous and skewed mathematical models in teaching.
