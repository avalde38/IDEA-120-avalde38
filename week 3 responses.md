<h1>Entagled</h1>
<p>Author Chris Salters' science fiction book "Entangled" The narrative centers on the idea of quantum entanglement, a phenomena in quantum physics in which particles entangle with one another so that, despite their distance from one another, their states are immediately influenced.

In the movie "Entangled," this idea is examined in the framework of a not too distant future in which researchers have figured out how to use and control quantum entanglement for a variety of uses, such as communication and transportation. The protagonist is probably drawn into a chain of events where the manipulation of entanglement has important ramifications; these events may touch on subjects like moral quandaries, the development of technology, and the nature of reality itself.</p>
