<p> Merritt Kopas' article "Videogames for Humans" explores the intriguing idea that video games could be a vehicle for addressing social  issues and personal experiences in addition to being a source of amusement. Kopas contends that underrepresented voices can tell their own tales and express their own opinions via video games, giving them a forum.Kopas uses the concept of "empathy games," or video games intended to elicit empathy and compassion toward different identities and experiences, as a central point of his thesis. These games subvert conventional ideas of gameplay and storytelling, frequently placing an emphasis on emotional connection and self-discovery over conventional goals like winning or hitting high scores. Kopas emphasizes how crucial these games are for promoting empathy and tearing down barriers between various social groups.
An other key principle covered in the article is "play as resistance." According to Kopas, play may be a tool for people to regain agency and subvert prevailing narratives in opposition to repressive systems and ideologies. Marginalized populations can make their presence in the gaming industry known and resist discriminatory behaviors by making and playing games that reflect their own experiences and values. All things considered, "Videogames for Humans" presents an engaging idea of video games as a vehicle for individual expression and social development. Kopas's observations push readers to reconsider their preconceptions of games and take into account the various ways in which they can be utilized to discuss difficult subjects and provide voice to those who are disenfranchised. </p>
